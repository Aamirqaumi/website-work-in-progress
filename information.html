<h1> Gate of Knowledge Library </h1>


    <p> “The Library is a refreshing entrant into the policy think tank space. I look forward to many years of policy & practice ideas <br> on what can shape & help ensure human flourishing, especially for the youngest and most vulnerable in society.”<br>
        — VINNY BADOLATO, VOQAL.
        
        
        <h2>Who we are</h2>


        <P>Libray is an independent, nonpartisan think tank with a global focus. Our purpose is to build a future in which all children and families flourish.<br>


            We stand at the edge of seismic shifts in the global economy and our political and environmental systems—systems that frequently ignore children.<br> Yet by prioritizing our youngest and their support networks we have the potential to radically<br> transform the social fabric of our societies for the long term. 
            
           Library explores how the great cultural,<br> planetary, and social transformations of our day affect our youngest children (0-8 years old) and our communities. We focus on the interrelated problems and injustices that prevent society from meeting the needs of children and families,<br> particularly those furthest from opportunity. From the impacts of climate change to parental loneliness and social disconnection, our work catalyzes <br>creative new ideas and solutions to some of the most pressing global challenges.  </P>
        <h2>Our vision</h2>
        <p>A future in which children and families can develop to realize their full potential in a just, peaceful, prosperous society on a healthier, cleaner and safer planet.</p>

        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <p>We take a long term, big picture view of those challenges: 

            We curate ideas from across disciplines and eras.
            
            We promote creative new solutions to legislative and executive decision-makers in local, state, and national governments, multilateral organizations, foundations, NGOs, and other institutions.
            
            We host conversations and debate, bringing together a diverse range of voices, backgrounds and perspectives.
            
            We provide foresight to leaders and organizations - fusing insights from the past, the present and the future.</p>

        <h2>How we do it</h2>
        <p>We do this by: 

            bringing together research, published analysis and commentary.
            
            hosting private seminars, workshops, public meetings and convenings.
            
            building cross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral networks to facilitate collaborative action.
            
            providing direct consultations to a range of global clients- from governments and think tanks, to private businesses and philanthropists.
            
            A not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization incorporated in the USA, we rely on the generous support of foundations, corporations, governments, and individuals.</p>

        <h2>Our commitment to being nonpartisan & independent</h2>
        <p>Consistent with our mission, Capita’s employees, contractors, and other stakeholders may provide analysis and recommendations<br> to elected officials and candidates for public office. However, employees, contractors, and other stakeholders <br>may not participate in partisan political activities on behalf of the organization. 

            In the spirit of creativity and the free exploration of ideas, Capita commissions products from diverse viewpoints<br> exploring how the great social and cultural transformations of our day affect young children, and to foster new ideas to ensure a future<br> in which all children and families flourish. The products we commission are intended to contribute to a public dialogue and foster debate. The views of any one <br>product represent those of the author and not necessarily the views of the organization, staff, Board of Directors, funders, or other stakeholders.</p>
